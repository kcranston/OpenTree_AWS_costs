# Open Tree of Life AWS usage

Open Tree of Life servers run on AWS infrastructure. This repo contains a .csv file with the monthly cost and an ipython notebook with stats and plots. 

To run the notebook:

    $ ipython notebook --pylab=inline

Which will open up the ipython notebook in your default browser. 

We maintain a [list of current servers](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/deployed-systems/blob/master/opentree-servers.txt) if you want details on our specific resources.
